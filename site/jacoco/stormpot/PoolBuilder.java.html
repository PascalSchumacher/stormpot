/**
 * The `PoolBuilder` collects information about how big a pool should be,
 * and how it should allocate objects, an so on, and finally acts as the
 * factory for building the pool instances themselves, with the
 * {@link #build()} method.
 *
 * Pool builder instances are obtained by calling {@link Pool#from(Allocator)}.
 *
 * This class is made thread-safe by having the fields be protected by the
 * intrinsic object lock on the `PoolBuilder` object itself. This way, pools
 * can `synchronize` on the builder object to read the values out atomically.
 *
 * The various set* methods are made to return the `PoolBuilder` instance
 * itself, so that the method calls may be chained if so desired.
 * 
 * @author Chris Vest &lt;mr.chrisvest@gmail.com&gt;
